<em>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=The_Fundamental_Theorem_of_Calculus" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/1-3-the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus" role="button">Sec. 1.3</a></h3>
<p>
Recall that for a continuous function $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$,
\[\int_a^b\,f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\]
is the <em>signed area</em> under $f$ in $[a,b]$. Intuitively, the positive areas comes from those regions where $f$ is positive and the negative ones from those where $f$ is negative, but the rigorous definition of this is done through <em>Riemann sums</em> where we use limits and that this notion is clear for locally constant functions (see <a href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/1-1-approximating-areas">sect. 1.1</a> and <a href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/1-2-the-definite-integral">1.2</a> for the details). The <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em> asserts that
\[\int_a^b\,f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t=F(b)-F(a)\]
where $F$ is an <em>antiderivative</em> of $f$, i.e., $F$ is a continuous function $F:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for every $x\in (a,b)$, $F'(x)$ exists and satisfies $F'(x)=f(x)$.
</p>
<p>
In another formulation of the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em>, we just say the function $F:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by
\[F(x):=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t\]
is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a,b]$, i.e., a continuous function derivable in $(a,b)$ and such that for all $x\in(a,b)$, $F'(x)=f(x)$. Note that this is equivalent to the above version due to <a href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-4-the-mean-value-theorem">the Mean Value Theorem (see Theorem 4.7 in Vol. 1)</a>. However, this version asserts succintly that the antiderivative of a continuous function exists, which is not necessarily clear from the version above.
</p>
<p>
The reason we call this theorem 'fundamental' is because it relates the two fundamental notions of calculus: the derivative—how does the function vary?—and the integral—how does the change accumulate?—. This theorem establishes a direct connection between these two fundamental notions of calculus, allowing us both to compute and study deeper how the functions that we encounter in the world change. A main focus of this course will be in how to use this theorem for computing areas and other physical quantities.

<em>Integration by Substitution</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Integration_by_Substitution" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/1-5-substitution" role="button">Sec. 1.5</a></h3>
<p>
The chain rule allows us to compute the derivative of a composition of functions, the analogue when we integrate is the so-called <em>integration by substitution</em>, <em>change of variables</em> or <em>$u$-substitution</em>. Change of variables is based on the following formula:
\[
\int_a^bf(g(u))g'(u)\,\mathrm{d}u=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}\,f(v)\,\mathrm{d}v
\]
where $f$ is continuous on the range of $g:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ whose derivative $g'$ is continuous. This formula allows to transform the functions that we have to integrate. Unfortunately, unlike the chain rule, integration by substitution is not automatic. Because of this, we need to practice in order to identify and come up with the correct change of variables.

<em>Area between Curves</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Area_between_Curves" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/2-1-areas-between-curves" role="button">Sec. 2.1</a></h3>
<p>
The definite integral is the signed area under a function. Because of this, we can use definite areas also to compute the area between two curves. More concretely, we want to find the area of the region bounded by the two curves given by $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ and the two vertical axis at $a$ and $b$. If the curves do not cross between $x=a$ and $x=b$ and $g(x)\leq f(x)$ for all $x\in [a,b]$, then the area is given by
\[\int_a^b\,(f(x)-g(x))\,\mathrm{d}x.\]

<em>Determining Volumes by Slicing</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Determining_Volumes_by_Slicing" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/2-2-determining-volumes-by-slicing" role="button">Sec. 2.2</a></h3>
<p>
To determine a volume, we can just slice the object and integrate along the areas of the different slices. The so-call <em>Slicing Method</em> or <em>Cavalieri's Principle</em> states that for a solid $K\subset\mathbb{R}$, we have
\[\mathrm{vol}(K)=\int_a^b\,A(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\]
where $A(x_0):=\mathrm{Area}(\{(y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^2\mid (x_0,y,z)\in K\})$ is the area of the intersection of $K$ with the plane $x=x_0$, and $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ are such that $X$ lies between the planes $x=a$ and $x=0$—i.e. $[a,b]\supseteq \{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid A(x)\neq 0\}$. This method is a higher dimensional version of how we compute the area of regions on the plane: we integrate the length of the slices of the two-dimensiuonal regions with a vertical line along the $x$-axis.
</p>
<p>
For a special kind of solids, <em>the solids of revolution</em>, produces by the rotation of a shape around an axis, the slicing method can be easily applied. Under the name of <em>Disk Method</em>, we have the formula
\[\int_a^b\,\pi(f(x))^2\,\mathrm{d}x\]
for computing the volume of rotating the region bounded by $y=f(x)$, $x=a$, $x=b$ and the $x$-axis around the $x$-axis. Under the name of <em>the Washer Method</em>, we have the formula
\[\int_a^b\,\pi\left[(f(x))^2-(g(x))^2\right]\,\mathrm{d}x\]
for computing the volume of rotating the region bounded above by $x=a$ and $x=b$, and above by $y=f(x)$ and below by $y=g(x)$ around the $x$-axis. However, these two formulas are just easy consequences of the Slicing Method or Cavaleri's Principle of the above paragraph.

<p>
A <em>cylindrical shell</em> is the figure obtaine by rotating the region delimited by $x=a$, $x=b$, $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis around the $y$-axis. We can see that the volume of this figure is given by
\[\int_a^b\,2\pi\,x\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x.\]
This allows us to compute further volumes which have rotational symmetry. Note that if we rotate with respect a different vertical axis, then we don't have $2\pi\,x$, but $2\pi\,\mathrm{distance}(x,\text{axis of rotation})$.

<em>Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Arc_Length_and_Surface_Area" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/2-4-arc-length-of-a-curve-and-surface-area" role="button">Sec. 2.4</a></h3>
<p>
If we consider $x\mapsto (x,f(x))$ as a curve in the plane, its velocity is given by $x\mapsto (1,f'(x))$ and, therefore, its speed by $x\mapsto \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}$. Hence the length of the graph of $f$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ is given by
\[\int_a^b\,\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\,\mathrm{d}x,\]
which is the integral of the infinitesimal length $\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\,\mathrm{d}x$ that we move along the vurve after an infinitesimal increase $\mathrm{d}x$ of $x$.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we can deduce that the surface area of the surface of revolution obtained by rotating the graph of $f$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ along the $x$-axis is given by
\[\int_a^b\,2\pi\,f(x)\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.\]
</p>
<p>
These formulas allow us to compute the length and surface area of many curves and surfaces that we encounter both in mathematics and applications. However, these integrals might be difficult to solve exactly.

Integrals appear in many applications in Physics. For example, they play a role in the computation of the mass of an object by integrating the density, the computation of the work of a force along a tranjectory and the hydrostatic force that the liquid does over an object submerged in the liquid.
</p>
<p>
Among the applications, the one covered in more detail will be about the computation of the work. The importance of the formula
\[W=\int_a^b\,F(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\]
lies in that it allows us to determine the amount of energy needed to move a given object, such as an object attached to an spring or pumping the water out of a tank up to a given height.

The <em>center of mass</em> of an object allows us to treat a non-punctual object as a punctual object located at the center of mass for many applications in physcis. This allows us to simplify many computations. For example, <em>Pappus' theorem</em> allows us to compute the volume of rotating a planar region along a line. More concretely, let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be some region and $L\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ a line not intersecting $K$, then the volume of the object of revolution $S$ obtained by rotating $K$ around $L$ is
\[\mathrm{vol}(S)=2\pi\, \mathrm{distance}(L,\mathrm{centroid}(K))\, \mathrm{Area}(K)\]
where $\mathrm{centroid}(K)$ is the center of mass of $K$ assuming that the density of $K$ is uniform.

<em>Integration by Parts</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Integration_by_Parts" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/3-1-integration-by-parts" role="button">Sec. 3.1</a></h3>
<p>
<em>Integration by parts</em> is the "product rule" of integratrion, although we cannot apply it automatically without making a choice. This technique of integration is usually summarizes as
\[\int\,u\,\mathrm{d}v=uv-\int\,v\,\mathrm{d}u,\]
which is a shorthand for
\[\int\,f(x)g'(x)\,dx=f(x)g(x)-\int\,g(x)f'(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\]
where we take $u=f(x)$ and $dv=g'(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$. Note that both of the above equalities are up to a constant, but for definite integration this is not the case, since
\[\int_a^b\,f(x)g'(x)\,dx=\left[f(b)g(b)-f(a)g(a)\right]-\int_a^b\,g(x)f'(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\]
is a full equality.
</p>
<p>
The power of integration by parts is that it allows us to integrate many functions, including some of the well-known ones: $\ln x$, $\arcsin x$, $\arccos x$, and $\arctan x$. Additional functions that we can integrate easy products such as $t^k\mathrm{e}^x$, $t^k\sin x$, $t^k\cos^x$, $\mathrm{e}^x\sin(ax)$ and $\mathrm{e}^x\cos(bx)$. Because of this, integration by parts is a fundamental tool in integration.

This city became the cultural center of the Ancient Greek World. This is the reason that people from Alexandria in Ancient times are described as Greek and not as Egyptian.

Polynomials are easy to integrate. Quotient of polynomials—_rational functions_—are not so easy to integrate, but we can still integrate them easily by writting them as sums of partial fractions. In theory, every rational fraction can be written as
\[
P(x)+\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}\frac{a_{i,j}}{(x-\zeta_i)^j}+\sum_{k=1}^s\sum_{l=1}^{n_k}\frac{b_{k,l}x+c_{k,l}}{(x^2+\beta_k x+\gamma_k)^l}
\]
where $P(x)$ is a polynomial, the $\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_r$ are the real zeros of the denominator with multiplicities $m_1,\ldots,m_r$, and $x^2+\beta_1 x+\gamma_1,\ldots,x^2+\beta_s x+\gamma_s$ are the irreducible factors of degree $2$ of the denominator with multiplicites $n_1,\ldots,n_s$—note that these come from the $2s$ conjugate pairs of complex roots of the denominator.
</p>
<p>
Using computational algebra, we can efficiently construct the above decomposition for a rational function and so efficiently integrate rational functions. For doing so, we will employ polynomial division, the Ruffini-Horner method, and logarithmic derivatives.

<p>
Up to now, we have handle integrals over bounded intervals of bounded functions, but what happens when the interval or the function becomes unbounded? These are the so-called <em>improper integrals</em> which arise naturally in many branches of science—such as physics and statistics. Among these integrals, we encounter two form of improper integrals: integrals of the form
\[\int_a^{\infty}\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,\,\int_{-\infty}^b\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\text{ and }\,\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,\]
and integrals of the form
\[\int_{a}^b\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\]
where for some $c\in [a,b]$, $f$ is discontinuous (and possibly undefined) at $c$. In the latter case, the most important case is when $\lim_{x\to c^-}f(x)=\pm\infty$ and/or $\lim_{x\to c^+}f(x)=\pm\infty$.
</p>
<p>
In this lecture, we will learn how to handle rigourously these improper integrals, i.e., we will leanr when we can assign a well-defined valuye to these integrals—when we say that the improper integral <em>converges</em>—and how to compute this value if this is the case.

Differential equations play a central role in science, as they allow us to describe precisely how the different variables that we measure change in terms of the other variables that we measure. In general, understanding how a variable of interest—such as position, heat, concentration of a certain molecule—means understanding the underlying differential equation that describes how it varies. Now, solving differential equations
\[\dot{x}=f(x,t),\]
where $\dot{x}$ denotes the derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$, is hard in general—note that a more propper formal way to write the differential equation is $\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t),t)$ since we are trying to find $x$ as a function $t\mapsto x(t)$ of $t$. Even when we are just interested in the evolution of a single variable $t\mapsto x(t)\in\mathbb{R}$ and not a vector function $t\mapsto x(t)\in\mathbb{R}^n$, finding the solution of these differential equations is hard.
</p>

In this introductory lecture, we will explore some of the uses and philosophies underlying the use of differential equations in science. This is a side lecture before the Spring Break to motivate the material seen until now in the course.

<em>Sequences I &amp; II</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Sequences" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/5-1-sequences" role="button">Sec. 5.1</a></h3>
<p>
In these lectures, we introduce <em>sequences</em>, their terminology and their properties. A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an ordered infinite list of numbers of the form
\[
a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,\ldots~\text{ or }~a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,\ldots
\]
where we call each number $a_n$, the <em>$n$th term of the sequence</em> and the subscript $n$ the <em>index variable of the term $a_n$</em>.
</p>
<p>
As we cannot give an infinite list of numbers by specifying each of the terms of the sequences. We have to give a sequence $\{a_n\}$ by specifying how to compute the general term $a_n$ out of the index variable $n$. To do this, we usually use either <em>formulas</em> or <em>recurrence relations</em>. For example, the sequence of odd numbers
\[
\{x_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}:=\{1,3,5,7,9,11,\ldots\}
\]
can be given by a formula as
\[
x_n=2n+1
\]
or by a recurrence relation as
\[
x_n=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }n=0\\a_{n-1}+2&\text{if }n\geq 1.\end{cases}
\]
In particular, we introduce <em>arithmetic</em> and <em>geometric</em> sequences which are respectively of the form $\{an+b\}$ and $\{cr^n\}$.
</p>
<p>
As the index variable $n$ goes to infinity, the $n$th term $a_n$ may approach a limit value $L$. We formally define the limit, $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n$, of a sequence $\{a_n\}$ as the unique number $L$ for which for all $\varepsilon>0$, there is a number $N_{\varepsilon}$ such that for every (index variable) $n\geq N_{\varepsilon}$,
\[L-\varepsilon< a_n< L+\varepsilon.\]
In other words, no matter how small $\varepsilon>0$ is, the sequence will eventually lie between $L-\varepsilon$ and $L+\varepsilon$. A sequence with a limit is called <em>convergent</em> if it has a limit, and <em>divergent</em> otherwise. For certain divergent sequences $\{a_n\}$, we write $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\infty$ or $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=-\infty$ to indicate that the limit does not exist because the sequence grows or decreases without a bound.
</p>
<p>
The first example, we study is that of a geometric series showing that
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}r^n=\begin{cases}\infty&\text{if }r>1\\1&\text{if }r=1\\0&\text{if }|r|<1\\\text{does not exist}&\text{if }r<-1.\end{cases}\]
After this example, we study the <em>algebraic laws</em> of limits, showing that for convergent sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$,
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}(a_n\pm b_n)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\pm\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n,\,\text{ and }\,\lim_{n\to\infty}(a_n b_n)=\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\right)\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n\right),\]
and, if $\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n\neq 0$,
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}(a_n/b_n)=\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\right)/\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n\right).
\]
We also study the <em>continuity law</em> which states that for $f:I\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous and a convergent sequence $\{a_n\}$,
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}f(a_n)=f\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\right).
\]
Finally, we study the <em>sandwich theorem</em> or <em>squeze theorem</em> that states that for sequences $\{a_n\}$, $\{b_n\}$ and $\{c_n\}$ such that $a_n\leq b_n\leq c_n$ and that $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}c_n=L$, we have that $\{b_n\}$ is convergent with
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L.\]
</p>
<p>
To end this lesson, we learn how to compute the limit of quotients. To do so, we estudy the orders of growth of different sequences, so that, by identifying the fastest grwing terms in the numerator and the denominator, we can compute the limit. In particular, we study the growth rates of sequences of the form $\{\ln^{\alpha}n\}$, $\{n^{\beta}\}$ and $\{r^n\}$, by showing that for $\alpha,\beta>0$ and $r>1$, we have
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\ln^{\alpha}n}{n^{\beta}}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\ln^{\alpha}n}{r^n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{\beta}}{r^n}=0.
\]
In other words, powers of logarithms grow qualitatively slower than powers which in turn grow qualitatively smaller than exponentials.
</p>
<p>
We end up considering the notions of <em>boundedness</em> and <em>monoticity</em> for sequences. We shows that every convergent sequence is bounded, although the converse is not true as the alternating sequence $\{(-1)^n\}$ shows. However, the <em>monotone convergence theorem</em> shows that a bounded monotone sequence is convergent. This theorem is useful to determine the existence of limits and compute them assuming that they exist.

<p>
A <em>series</em> is an infinite sum. To define the value of a series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ we consider the finite sums $\sum_{n=1}^Na_n$ and consider the limit as we add more and more summands, i.e.,
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n:=\lim_{N\to \infty}\sum_{n=1}^Na_n.
\]
It is important to observe that the initial index does not have to start with $n=1$, but it also can start with $n=0$ or with any other integer value. In general, we can always rewrite $\sum_{n=c}^\infty a_n$ as $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n+c}$. Also, we note that when all the terms of a series are non-negative, then, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the limit sum is either a finite real number or $\infty$.
</p>
<p>
After introducing series, we show the <em>algebraic laws</em> of limits, which state that
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ca_n=c\,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n~\text{ and }~\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(a_n\pm b_n)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n\pm \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n
\]
for $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n$ convergent. We note that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(a_n+b_n)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n$ is still true for series of non-negative terms.
</p>
<p>
We finish the lesson by introducing some examples, among which the most important ones are the <em>harmonic series</em>, the <em>geometric series</em> and the <em>telescoping series</em>. The harmonic series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ is a divergent series for which we can show that $\sum_{n=1}^{2^N}\frac{1}{n}\geq 1+\frac{1}{2}(N-1)$ and so
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}=\infty.\]
The geometric series is a series of the form $\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n$ for which we can obtain its exact value by noting that for the partial sum $\sum_{n=0}^Nr^n$ we have
\[(1-r)\sum_{n=0}^Nr^n=\sum_{n=0}^N(r^n-r^{n+1})=(1-r)+(r-r^2)+\cdots+(r^N-r^{N+1})=1-r^{N+1}.\]
Using this identity, we obtain that the geometric series converges if and only if $|r|< 1$, and that then
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}r^n=\frac{1}{1-r}
~\text{ and }~
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}r^n=\frac{r}{1-r}.
\]
Finally, a telescoping series is a series that can be written in the form
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (b_n-b_{n+1}).
\]
For such a series, we have that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty (b_n-b_{n+1})=b_0-\lim_{n\to\infty}b_{n}$ and so it is convergent if and only if $\{b_n\}$ is convergent. One should observe that a telescoping series might not be recognizable at first sight, such as
\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\right).\]

<em>MathInContext</em>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno's paradoxes</a> are paradoxes related to infinity posed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea">the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea</a>. Calculus can be seen as a solution to the so-called Zeno's paradoxes of motion. Funnily, while Zeno was stating his paradoxes and affirming the movement didn't exist at all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes">the Greek philosopher Diogenes</a> stood up quietly and went away walking. This led to the expression</p>
<blockquote style="text-align:center;font-variant: small-caps;">
Movement is proven by Walking.
</blockquote>
<p>
and the expression <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvitur_ambulando"><em>solvitur ambulando</em></a> (it is solved by walking) which is used to emphasize practical experience in the solution to certain theoretical problems. One of the aparadoxes, known as <em>Achilles and the tortoise</em>, is, as retold by Aristotles, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%;">
In a race, the quickest runner (Achilles) can never over­take the slowest (the tortoise), since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead.
</blockquote>
<p>
To solve the paradox, we can use the geometric series. Assume that Achilles runs at a constant speed $V$ and the tortoise at a constant speed $v$ having the tortoise a distance advantage of $s$ over Achilles. Initially, Achilles traverse this distance $s$ in a time of $s/V$. However, in that time the tortoise has moved $sv/V$. Again, Achilles has to traverse this distance, which reach after a time of $sv/V^2$, but in this time the tortoise has moved $(sv/V^2)v=s(v/V)^2$. Continuing so an so, we see that Achilles will reach the tortoise in a time of
\[
\frac{s}{V}+\frac{sv}{V^2}+\frac{sv^2}{V^3}+\frac{sv^3}{V^5}+\cdots=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{sv^n}{V^{n+1}}.
\]
Now, since Achilles is faster than the tortoise, $v< V$, and so this a converging geometric series with a value of
\[
\frac{s}{V}\frac{1}{1-\frac{v}{V}}=\frac{s}{V-v}.
\]

<em>The Divergence and Integral Tests</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=The_Divergence_and_Integral_Tests" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/5-3-the-divergence-and-integral-tests" role="button">Sec. 5.3</a></h3>
<p>
The <em>divergence test</em> states that for a convergent series $\sum_{n}a_n$ we have that
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=0.\]
In other words, if a series is convergent, then the general term convergences to zero. However, although this is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient, since there are series, such as the Harmonic Series, which satisfy the divergence test, but that are diverging.
</p>
<p>
The <em>integral test</em> is one of the most powerful criterions for convergence. In one of its forms, it states that: given a series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n$ of non-negative terms and decreasing function $f:[0,\infty)\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ such that $a_n=f(n)$, then $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n$ converges if and only if $\int_0^{\infty}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$ converges. Moreover, one can refine this result to obtain error bounds for the approximation of the series in terms of the partial sums. Unfortunately, finding the function $f:[0,\infty)\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ in the statement of the integral test is the most difficult part for applying the test. This can be seen in the series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{n^2}+\sin^2(\pi n)\right)
\]
which is convergent, but for which the naive choice $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}+\sin^2(\pi x)$ gives a function for which $\int_1^\infty$\,f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$ diverges—note that $f$ is not decreasing in this case.
</p>
<p>
The most important case of application of the integral test are $p$-series. A <em>$p$-series</em> is a series of the form
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p},
\]
which, for $p=1$, we recover the Harmonic Series. For these series, using the integral test, we have that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}$ converges if and only if $p>1$.

<em>Comparison Test</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Comparison_Tests" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/5-4-comparison-tests" role="button">Sec. 5.4</a></h3>
<p>
The <em>comparisson test</em> allows us to determine the convergence of a non-negative series by comparing it with another non-negative series. This test is as follows: Let $\sum_na_n$ and $\sum_nb_n$ be series of non-negative terms such that for all sufficiently large $n$, $a_n\leq b_n$. If $\sum_na_n$ diverges, then $\sum_nb_n$ diverges; and if $\sum_nb_n$ converges, then $\sum_na_n$ converges. This test is used by comparing with well-known series such as the geometric series and the $p$-series.
</p>
<p>
The <em>limit comparisson test</em> allows us to determine the convergence/divergence of a series by assymptotically comparing the series with another one. In its most simple form, it states the following: Let $\sum_na_n$ and $\sum_nb_n$ be series of non-negative terms. If $\lim_{n\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}=L\in (0,\infty)$, then $\sum_na_n$ converges if and only if $\sum_nb_n$ converges. However, if $\lim_{n\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}=0$ and $\sum_nb_n$ converges, then $\sum_na_n$ converges; and if $\lim_{n\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}=\infty$ and $\sum_nb_n$ diverges, then $\sum_na_n$ diverges.
</p>
<p>
To use the limit comparisson test the best way is to identify the order of growth of the general term of the series. For example, to determine the convergence of
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{6n-5}{2n^3-n},\]
we note that the fastest growing term in the numerator is $6n$ and in the denominator is $2n^3$. Hence, we obtain that
\[
1=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{6n-5}{2n^3-n}\right)/\left(\frac{6n}{2n^3}\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{6n-5}{2n^3-n}\right)/\left(\frac{3}{n^2}\right).
\]
Hence $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{6n-5}{2n^3-n}$ converges if and only if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{3}{n^2}$ converges. However, the latter is a $2$-series, and so it converges. In this way, the limit comparisson test allows us to determine converge by looking at the order of convergence to zero of the general term of the series.

<em>Alternating Sequences</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Alternating_Series" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/5-5-alternating-series" role="button">Sec. 5.5</a></h3>
<p>
We study why the Alternating Harmonic Series,
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n},
\]
converges. After thinking how this happens, we arrived to the so-called <em>Alternating Series Test</em> (also known as <em>Leibniz's Criterion</em>) which states that for a decreasing sequences $\{a_n\}$ of non-negative numbers converging to zero, i.e., for all $n$, $a_n\geq a_{n+1}\geq 0$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=0$; the alternating series
\[
\sum_n(-1)^na_n
\]
converges.
</p>
<p>
By considering re-orderings of the Alternating Harmonic Series, we see that
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n}~\text{ and }~\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{4n-2}+\frac{1}{4n}-\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)\]
have different sums. In other words, infinite sums might not be commutative. Because of this, we say that a series $\sum_na_n$ is <em>absolutely convergent</em> if
\[\sum_n|a_n|\]
converges, and <em>conditionally convergent</em> if it is convergent, but not absolutely convergent. We can easily see that absolutely convergent series are convergent, which allow us to use the tests we know for non-negative series for general series.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we introduce <em>Riemann's Rearrangement Theorem</em> which motivates why we differentiate between absolute and conditional convergence. The theorem states the following: If $\sum_na_n$ converges absolutely, then, no matter how we re-arrange its terms, the series will converge to the same limit. However, if $\sum_na_n$ converges conditionally, then we can re-arrange the terms of the series in such a way that the series converges to any real number, or that it diverges to $\infty$, $-\infty$ or no value at all.

<em>Ratio and Root Tests</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Ratio_and_Root_Tests" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/5-6-ratio-and-root-tests" role="button">Sec. 5.6</a></h3>
<p>
The ratio and root tests are tests based in the assymptotic comparisson with a geometric series. For the <em>ratio test</em>, we consider
\[
\rho=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|},
\]
and for the <em>root test</em>,
\[
\rho=\lim_{n\to\infty}|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}}.
\]
In both cases, we have that if $\rho< 1$, then the series $\sum_n a_n$ is absolutely convergent; and if $\rho>1$, then $\sum_n a_n$ is divergent. However, if $\rho=1$, we cannot conclude anything.
</p>
<p>
In general, the root test is stronger than the ratio test. If both $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_n|}$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}}$ exist, then they are equal. However, for some series, such as
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty 3^{-n+\sin(n)},\]
the ratio test gives absolute convergence, while the ratio test is inconclusive.

<em>Power Series and Functions</em><a class="btn btn-wiki" href="https://mathresearch.utsa.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Power_Series_and_Functions" role="button">UTSA Wiki</a><a class="btn btn-book" href="https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/6-1-power-series-and-functions" role="button">Sec. 6.1</a></h3>
<p>
A <em>power series</em> is a series of the form
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n
\]
where $\{c_n\}$ is a sequence, $x$ a real variable and, by convention, $x^0=1$—even for $x=0$. The above series is said to be centered at $x=0$. However, we can consider also a <em>power series centered at $x=a$</em> of the form
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n.
\]
</p>
<p>
Observe that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$ always converges for $x=a$ (and to the value $c_0$). However, power series might converge to more values. In general, for a power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$, one of the following three exclusive possibilities happens:
</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$ converges for $x=a$ and diverges for $x\neq a$.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is $R>0$ such that the series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$ converges absolutely for $|x-a|< R$, diverges for $|x-a|> R$ and it may converge/diverge for $|x-a|=R$.
  </li>
  <li>
    The series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$ converges for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
In view of the above theorem, we call
\[\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\text{ converges}\right\}\]
the <em>interval of convergence</em> of $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$, and
\[
\sup\left\{R\geq 0\mid \text{for }|x-a|< R\text{, }\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\text{ converges}\right\}
\]
the <em>radius of convergence</em> of $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n$, which might be zero (case a) or $\infty$ (case c). Note that the interval of convergence can be of the form $(a-R,a+R]$ or $[a-R,a+R)$ as the power series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}x^n
\]
with interval of convergence $(-1,1]$ and radius of convergence $R=1$.
</p>
<p>
As of now, we have seen one power series, the geometric series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x_n$. This power series has radious of convergence $1$ and interval of convergence $(-1,1)$, where this series satisfies
\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty x_n=\frac{1}{1-x}.\]
Note that combining this series and using the algebraic laws for series, we can write several rational functions where zero is not a root of the denominator as power series centered at $x=0$.

<p>
How can generate new power series out of series that we now? We can add, multiply, differentiate and integrate existing power series in order to get new ones. In this way, given power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n$ and $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \tilde{c}_nx^n$ and $x\in I$ where $I$ is an interval where both series converge absolutely, we have the following:
\[\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n\right)\pm \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \tilde{c}_nx^n\right)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(c_n\pm \tilde{c}_n\right)x^n\]
\[\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \tilde{c}_nx^n\right)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\sum_{i=0}^n c_i \tilde{c}_{n-i}\right)x^n\]
\[\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n\right)'=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(c_n x^n\right)'=\sum_{n=0}^\infty n c_n x^{n-1}\]
\[\int\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n\right)\mathrm{d}x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \int\left(c_n x^n\right)\mathrm{d}x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{c_n}{n+1} x^{n+1}+C\]
\[\int_a^x\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nt^n\right)\mathrm{d}t=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_a^x\left(c_n t^n\right)\mathrm{d}t=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{c_n}{n+1} x^{n+1}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{c_n}{n+1} a^{n+1}\]
Hence, by doing arithmetic operations and differentiating and integrating term-by-term power series, we can power series for new functions in term of old functions. For example, by integrating
\[\frac{1}{1+x^2}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^nx^{2n},\]
we obtain
\[\arctan(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}x^{2n+1}\]
with radius of convergence $1$. Now, for $x=1$, this series converges by the alternating series test, and so
\[\frac{\pi}{4}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}.\]

<p>
For now, we only now how to sum one power series: the geometric series. However, the <em>Taylor series</em> of a function $f:I\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ at a point $a$,
\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(a)(x-a)^n=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2+\frac{f'''(a)}{6}(x-a)^3+\cdots,\]
allows us to obtain power series for the so-called <em>analytic functions</em>, which includes the exponential, the sine, the cosine, the tangent, the $n$th root (of a positive number) and all the functions obtained by adding, substacting, multiplying, dividing and composing them.
</p>
<p>
In general, it is difficult to tell if an arbitrary function can be written as a Taylor series. Even if the series converges, there is no guarantee of equality beyond the center. For example, the function
\[f(x)=\begin{cases}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{x^2}}&\text{if }x\neq 0\\0&\text{if }x=0\end{cases}\]
has the Taylor series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty 0x^n$ at $0$, but it is equal to zero only at $x=0$. However, to obtain obtaining the sum of different power series, it is enough to know the power series of the elementary functions mentioned in the previous paragrapgh and know how to combine them to obtain the power series we want to obtain the value of.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the <em>Taylor's theorem with Remainder</em> states that for $x\in [a-R,a+R]$,
\[\left|f(x)-\sum_{n=0}^N\frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(a)(x-a)\right|\leq \frac{1}{(N+1)!}\max_{t\in [a-R,a+R]}\left|f^{(N+1)}(t)\right|R^{N+1}.\]
This result allow us to estimate any sufficiently good function $f$ by partial sums of its Taylor series around any point, even if the Taylor series does not converge to the function.

<div id="grading">
<h2 class="display-4">Grading</h2>
<p>
The grade in this course will depend on homework, three midterm exams and one (compulsory) final exam according to the following formula:
</p>
\[\frac{HW+ME_1+ME_2+ME_3+FE}{5}\in [0,100]\]
<p>
where $HW\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the homework, $ME_1\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the 1st midterm exam, $ME_2\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the 2nd midterm exam, $ME_3\in [0,100]$ is the 3rd midterm exam and $FE\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the final exam. Note that each one of these grade is a numerical scale from $0$ to $100$.
</p>
<p>
Once the numerical grade is computed, this will be converted to a letter grade as follows:
</p>
<table style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <tr style="background-color:#F15A22;color:white;text-align:center;">

<p>However, there are a couple of extra rules that will be taken into account when computing the final grade: the back up grade policy, and the extra credit for practice problems.</p>
<h3>Back Up Grade Policy</h3>
<p>
If the grade in the final exam is greater than the grade in any of the midterm exams, then the grade in the final exam will substitute the lowest grade in a midterm exam when computing the final grade. In other words, the actual formula to compute the final grade will be:
</p>
\[\frac{HW+\max\left\{ME_1+ME_2+ME_3+FE,ME_2+ME_3+2\,FE,ME_1+ME_3+2\,FE,ME_1+ME_2+2\,FE\right\}}{5}\in [0,100]\]
<p>
where $HW\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the homework, $ME_1\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the 1st midterm exam, $ME_2\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the 2nd midterm exam, $ME_3\in [0,100]$ is the 3rd midterm exam and $FE\in [0,100]$ is the grade on the final exam.
</p>
<p><em>Extreme example:</em> Imagine that you were unable to take one of the midterm exams, because you fell asleep. Because of this, you got zero points in that midterm exam. However, not everything would be lost. The back up grade policy guarantees that your grade in the final exam will substitute the zero grade in the midterm exam when computing the final grade. However, note that if you miss two final exams, then the grade in the final exam would only substitute <b>one</b> of the zero grades, not both of them.</p>
<h3>Extra Credit for Practice Problems</h3>
<p>
Before each of the midterm exams and the final exam, a set of practice problems will be available through WeBWork. The 10% of the grade (from 0 to 100 points) obtained in these practice set will be added to the corresponding exam. Hence a student can take an exam with as many as 10 extra bouns point if E completes successfully the practice problems before the exam.
</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div id="homework">
<h2 class="display-4">Homework</h2>
<p>
All homework will be assigned through WeBWork. You can access WebWork through the following link using your UTSA credentials. In case you cannot access, please, <b>let me know immediately</b>.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
  <a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://webwork.math.utsa.edu/webwork2/MAT_1224_009_Spring_2023/" role="button" style="width:30%;">WebWork</a>
</p>
<p>
To complete each of the assignments, you will have until the Sunday of the week after the opening date. In case you miss this first deadline, you will have an extra week to complete the assignments for 70% of the original credit.
</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div id="exams">
<h2 class="display-4">Exams</h2>
<p>
There will be three midterm exams and one compulsory final exam, which must be taken to pass the course. In all the exams, the use of a scientific (non-graphing) calculator without internet capabilities is allowed. However, under no circumstances are students permitted to utilize an online resource, website or tutor to find solutions to exam problems.
</p>
<h3>Midterm Exams</h3>
<p>
There will be three midterm exams administered during the class. Each of these exams will consist of written problems similar to the homework problems and examples discussed in class. The exams will have a time limit of 50 minutes.
</p>
<p>
The midterm exams will take place in the following days (any change will be communicated in advance):
</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li><b>1st Midterm Exam:</b> February 13, 8:00 am - 8:50 am.</li>
  <li><b>2nd Midterm Exam:</b> March 8, 8:00 am - 8:50 am.</li>
  <li><b>3rd Midterm Exam:</b> April 19, 8:50 am - 9:40 am.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you cannot attend the class the day of the midterm exam, you should inform the instructor as soon as possible and always before the exam. Otherwise, no alternative arrangement will be possible.</p>
<h3>Final Exam (May 10, 9:00 am-10:50 am)</h3>
<p>
In accordance with the <a href="https://asap.utsa.edu/terms.htm">2023 Spring Final Exam Schedule</a>, the final exam of this course will on Wednesday, May 10, from 9.00 am to 10:50 am. The final exam will consist of written problems similar to the homework problems and problems from the midterm exams. More details on the location will be given later.
